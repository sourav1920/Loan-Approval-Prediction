Project Report: Loan Approval Prediction

1. Abstract:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using PySpark to predict loan approval status. The dataset contains various features related to the applicant's financial status, assets, and loan details. Three models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—are trained and evaluated. The project demonstrates data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

2. Introduction:
Machine learning has become a crucial tool in financial institutions for automating decision-making processes, such as loan approvals. This project explores the use of PySpark for handling large datasets and performing machine learning tasks. The goal is to build and compare different classification models to predict loan approval status based on the applicant's financial attributes.
Background Information -Loan approval is a critical process in the banking industry, where numerous factors influence the decision. By leveraging historical data, machine learning models can assist in predicting whether a loan should be approved or rejected, potentially increasing efficiency and accuracy.
Statement of the Problem -The primary problem addressed in this project is predicting the loan approval status based on an applicant’s financial and demographic details. The challenge lies in accurately classifying the loans using the provided features.
Objectives of the Project - To preprocess and clean the provided dataset for machine learning purposes.
1.	To train and evaluate multiple classification models using PySpark.
2.	To compare the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM in predicting loan approval status.
Overview of the Methodology Used - The project involves several key steps:
1.	Data collection and preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset.
2.	Feature engineering to convert categorical features into numerical ones.
3.	Model training using PySpark's machine learning library.
4.	Model evaluation using accuracy as the primary metric.


3. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Description of the Data Sources - The dataset used in this project is sourced from a loan approval dataset containing various attributes related to loan applicants, including demographic and financial details. The dataset is available as a CSV file.
Details of Data Preprocessing Steps
1.	Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring column names are consistent.
2.	Outlier Detection: Using Z-scores and the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and potentially remove outliers.
3.	Label Encoding: Categorical variables like education, self_employed, and loan_status were encoded into numerical values using LabelEncoder.
4.	Train-Test Split: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.


4. Methodology:
Description of the Machine Learning Algorithms
1.	Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary classification, predicting the probability of a binary outcome.
2.	Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
3.	Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning model that finds the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes.


5. Results:
Presentation of Experimental Results - The models were trained and evaluated on the test dataset. The accuracy of each model was calculated to compare their performance.
Performance Metrics - Accuracy was the primary metric used to evaluate model performance.
Comparison of Models
1.	Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of X%.
2.	Random Forest: Achieved an accuracy of Y%.
3.	Support Vector Machine: Achieved an accuracy of Z%.
Visualizations - Visualizations such as box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts were used to explore the data and model predictions.


6. Discussion:

Interpretation of Results - The Random Forest model performed the best, suggesting that an ensemble approach is more effective for this dataset. Logistic Regression, being a simpler model, performed reasonably well but was outperformed by Random Forest.
Strengths and Weaknesses
•	Strengths: Random Forest's ability to handle large datasets and high-dimensional spaces proved advantageous.
•	Weaknesses: SVM struggled with the dataset, potentially due to the linear separation assumption.
Unexpected Outcomes - The SVM model performed worse than expected, possibly due to the high dimensionality and non-linear relationships in the data.
Comparison with Prior Work - This project’s approach is consistent with common practices in the industry, where Random Forest is often favored for its robustness and accuracy.



7. Conclusion:

Summary of Key Findings - The Random Forest model outperformed both Logistic Regression and SVM in predicting loan approval status.
Achievement of Project Objectives - All project objectives were met, including successful data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Recommendations for Future Work - Future work could involve using more advanced techniques like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks to potentially improve accuracy. Additionally, exploring feature selection techniques could enhance model performance.
